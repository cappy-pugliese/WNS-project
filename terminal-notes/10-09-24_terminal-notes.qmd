### 10-9

-   successfully logged onto HPC storrs

-   started an interactive session

    -   session quit unexpectedly due to "broken pipe"

    -   logged back in and cancelled the session then created a new session

-   created a new data directory, new temporary data folder

    -   trying to download sequence data

    -   seeing if I can use a python script shortcut to download the data

    -   had to load in python

        -   uses pip to install package, but the pip command is not working

        -   pip is installed, so idk why its not working

-   session timed out bc I had it set to only last one hour, so I can try to figure this out another day

### 10-10

-   made a shortcut to pip in my directory

    -   '\_\_main\_' not found error

    -   gave up

    -   SRA toolkit might be able to download it, i may be an idiot

-   storrs HPC doesnt even look like they have SRA toolkit installed

    -   may have to use farmington cluster for sequence stuff or download sratoolkit to directory

### 10/11

-   logged onto xanadu cluster

-   able to load in sra toolkit

-   created dir: data/sra_seq

-   set prefetch to new directory

-   prefetched SRX8363356

-   extracted file with fastq

-   tried to analyze using fastqc but run was killed

    -   generated a fastqc zip file but not a viewable html file

    -   looks like I may have run out of memory

    -   next time try initiating an interactive session with 2G of memory
