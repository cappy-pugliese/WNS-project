-   successfully logged onto HPC storrs

-   started an interactive session

    -   session quit unexpectedly due to "broken pipe"

    -   logged back in and cancelled the session then created a new session

-   created a new data directory, new temporary data folder

    -   trying to download sequence data

    -   seeing if I can use a python script shortcut to download the data

    -   had to load in python

        -   uses pip to install package, but the pip command is not working

        -   pip is installed, so idk why its not working

-   session timed out bc I had it set to only last one hour, so I can try to figure this out another day
